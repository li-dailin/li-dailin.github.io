excerpt: '**Abstract:** Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis, aiding in the precise delineation of anatomical or pathological structures. Traditional methods relying on handcrafted features are being surpassed by deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which excel at feature extraction. However, 2D approaches may not fully exploit the spatial information in 3D medical data. Recent advancements, including 3D U-Net and Transformer-integrated models, aim to address these limitations by improving global contextual modeling. Despite progress, challenges persist due to the complexity of anatomical structures and limited annotated datasets. This paper surveys current 3D medical image segmentation methods and replicates state-of-the-art models, focusing on both single-dataset models (nnU-Net etc) and unified models for large-scale datasets. Additionally, it proposes enhancements to existing 3D medical CT image segmentation methods to improve accuracy and address challenges.'
